# WaveICA
Removal of batch effects for large-scale untargeted metabolomics data based on wavelet analysis.
The WaveICA R package provides a new algorithm to removing batch effects for metabolomics data. The details of this method are in the paper "WaveICA: a novel algorithm to remove batch effects for large-scale untargeted metabolomics data based on wavelet analysis". 

You can install WaveICA Package Using the following commands:
    
    library(devtools)
    devtools::install_github("dengkuistat/WaveICA",host="https://api.github.com")

When using this method, please cite as: Kui Deng, Fan Zhang, Qilong Tan, Yue Huang, Wei Song, Zhiwei Rong, Zhengjiang Zhu, Kang Li, Zhenzi Li.
