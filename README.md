# WaveICA
Removal of batch effects for large-scale untargeted metabolomics data based on wavelet analysis.
The WaveICA R package provides a new algorithm to removing batch effects for metabolomics data. The details of this
method are in the papers "[WaveICA: a novel algorithm to remove batch effects for large-scale untargeted metabolomics
data based on wavelet analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2019.02.010)" and "[WaveICA 2.0: a novel batch effect
removal method for untargeted metabolomics data without using batch information](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11306-021-01839-7)."

This fork is a slightly modified WaveICA by [RECETOX](https://github.com/RECETOX) that includes both original WaveICA
and WaveICA 2.0 and contains fewer dependencies.

You can install WaveICA Package Using the following commands:
    
    library(devtools)
    devtools::install_github("RECETOX/WaveICA",host="https://api.github.com")

To run WaveICA , you can use the following command:
    
    library(WaveICA)
    features <- WaveICA(features_table, wf, batch, factorization, group, K, t, t2, alpha)

Alternatively, if your data contains no batch information or the samples have been measured in a single batch you can run:

    library(WaveICA)
    features <- WaveICA_nonbatchwise(features_table, wf, injection_order, alpha, cutoff, K)

For further information on how to use the tool please refer to our docs in this repository.
